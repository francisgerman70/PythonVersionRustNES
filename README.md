# PythonVersionRustNES (IN_PROGRESS)
Recreating milestone 1 and parts of milestone 2 of the RustNES project in python

## Description
Retro chiptune music is starting to make a resurgence with the popularity of many retro indie games like Hades and Celeste. However, a majority of music produced for these games rarely use actual hardware that made the 8-bit and 16-bit music charming. The purpose of this project is to replicate a sound chip from the NES using Rust.
